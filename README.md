# my-scripts

A repo for some of my personal scripts that I making public:

 * **cert-check:** retrieves the x509 SSL certificate data for a domain using HTTPS.
 * **cert-recon:** retrieves all certificates issued for a particular domain name from public certificate transparency logs, using https://crt.sh/
 * **deardiary:** a script to lock (encrypt) and unlock (decrypt) a plain-text diary file.
